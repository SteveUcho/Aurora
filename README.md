# Aurora
- Hey there
This is Aurora - its just a placeholder
- Hoping to make this an educational machine learning visualizer

# What I mean
You'll be able to create, run, and debug your models using Aurora
Most of all, little to no code would be required!
- It will use basic drag and drop features to add layers, etc...
-  "   "   "  suggest best models for specific purposes
- and (hopefully) much more!
